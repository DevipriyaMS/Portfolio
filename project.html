                <h2>Automatic Pothole Detection</h2>
                <p>This project aimed at detecting potholes on roads using a miniature model equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3, a Camera Module, an Ultrasonic Sensor, and a Solenoid Valve.</p><p>The system is designed to semi-automatically detect potholes on roads and trigger the deployment of fillers to patch them up. This technology can help in identifying road hazards and facilitating timely repairs, contributing to safer and smoother travels.</p>

                <h2>Smart Glasses for Blind People</h2>
                <p>This is an assistive technology developed to enhance the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals which uses Raspberry Pi 3, a Camera Module, Ultrasonic Sensor, PIR Sensor and Mic.</p><p>The glasses are equipped with obstacle detection, face recognition and distance detection capabilities. This assists users in navigating their surroundings more confidently and improves their quality of life by providing real-time feedback about obstacles and recognizing familiar faces.</p>
